1,Olivia Rodrigo,Good 4 U,f,3,"Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold a house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said)
I still belong (still belong)
Don't get me wrong (don't get me wrong)
You can speak your mind but not on my time
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
Oh, but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
Either way it's okay, you wake up with yourself
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life

I was doin' 80 on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country n- never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Gardens sittin' half court

Better leave it tucked, 'cause y'ain't dumpin'

Scoop up a dime-piece like we homeless
Then we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed
Out of the concrete was a rose and windows was cold
Had to go over and stand by the stove
We from the Southeast, n- know
This where the opps creep real slow
Won't vote but they mob deep with the poles
I punch the time sheet, not no more
And now my assigned seat is a throne

And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Uh
Terrified, paranoid, I'll put you over everything to fill the void
And when you're gone, will I have anything or will I be destroyed? Yeah

Bright lights pass me in the city, it's emergency
I'm thankful 'cause I made it past my thirties, no one murdered me
Still remember vividly the nigga that pulled a gun on me
I'm petrified, but moving like I got no sense of urgency
Pride make a nigga act way harder than he really be
Pride hide the shame when city cut off all utilities
Pride hide the pain of growing up inhaling poverty
Pride make a nigga feel a way that you unfollowed me
Make a nigga flash a thousand like he hit the lottery
Make a baby mama make shit harder than it gotta be
Make you have to take the bitch to court to see your prodigy
Make you have to use your last resort and pull a robbery
Pride be the reason for the family dichotomy
Got uncles and some aunties that's too proud to give apologies
Slowly realizing what the root of all my problems be
It got me feeling different when somebody say they proud of me

Then pay somebody to make sure whatever amount he say he can back it up
Got racks on racks, I'm rackin' up, stackin' up
You're reachin', I'm actin' up

Break it down, weigh it up, now bag it up
Making five a month, that's regular
Nigga playing with us, that's a negative
Go back to start, that's never
I'm a boss, my closet leather
Ain't no off-days on my schedule
Long as I live, we live forever
Told my twin this shit get better
These niggas done slipped, let me ahead 'em
Got my feet up, I paid silly bands to have sex on the jet
I don't need 'em, that shit in the past, I'm feelin' like what's next
Got my speed up, foot all on the gas, this not a C8 'Vette
I can beat 'em, I believe in me, just tell me what's the bet
All my pride gone, had to lose it all then I got rich
I own five homes, glad some of this shit starting to make sense
I'm staying hella focused and I can't forget the bigger picture
I can't even hold you, I didn't have shit, I won't forget it
Will I be destroyed?
Come to me with everything, it's starting to get annoying
I'm addicted to promethazine, it's crazy, yeah, I know it
All this money coming in, it drive me crazy not to show it
I'll be crazy if I blow it

If I'm bettin' on myself, then I'll completely double down
If you hated on a nigga, please don't greet me with a pound

Could put a M right on your head, you Luigi brother now

Back and forth from NC to New York when Jeezy had the crown
Vivid memories, niggas start to squeeze, we duckin' down
So many shells left on the ground, it make the Easter Bunny proud

Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine
They say that I'm so fine
You could never match my crime
Please do not now waste my time

What you know about rolling down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy

I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, ""Who asked y'all?""
See, they told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum, I told her, ""Keep me clean, "" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', ""Free Drizzy""
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, ""I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit""
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi
Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic
One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, ""Well, bitch, come and convince me""
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene
You know, one of the perils of makin' money
Is you can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj
And y'all still dyin, ' man, wassup? We in this bitch
This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin'
Who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin'? Who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, ""Nice to meet ya""
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a façade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green

Yeah, nigga (One two, one two, one)
The Off-Season (One two, one two, one two, one)
The Off-Season, nigga
We off of niggas (Ayy, that's right)
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? (That's right, ayy)
Off of niggas (Yeah, hey, yeah)
(Vocal up a little more, hey)

Uh, applying pressure
Started my grind where crime festers
And now it's showing like they in they second trimesters (Pregnant)
That's why when nigga's throw a shot or two online
I pay no mind to their benign gestures (Mm)
Nigga, please, I got my mind on much bigger things to say the least
My latest beat just sound like they was released by David East (What up East?)
Verses hit hard, never pitched hard or played the streets
These niggas whips hard, behind closed doors, can't pay the lease (Uh)
Ain't nothin' wrong with livin' check to check 'cause most have to (I understand that)
Instead of cappin', why don't you talk about being a broke rapper? (I don't understand that)
That's a perspective I respect because it's real
What it's like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills
That was me in '08, seein' no cake
Not even on dates or celebrated my birth
Just did the mental math and calculated my worth
Shit crazy, didn't know I got more M's than a real Slim Shady video
(How many of us in here?)
Big Boss, less Rick Ross, more like a wavy Hideo
Kojima, they tote steamers around the way we tippy-toe
'Round crack vials and cold-blooded killers, no reptiles
Just projectiles, from niggas salty you rockin' the fresher textiles
I seen best pals grow up and switch (I hate to see it)
Sometimes over a couple dollars, more often over a bitch (Ah, I hate to see it)
I can cap and say that I never scratched my jealousy's itch
But thank God I conquered that 'cause if not I'd never be rich
Envy, keep your pockets empty, so just focus on you
If you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you
Money ain't everything, I never say that (Never)
But niggas throw stones knowin' they sell soul to get wherever they at (Come on, man)
Just know these verses is some shit they gon' forever playback, nigga (Come on, nigga)

Hell yeah (Ooh)
Fuck, you know what it is nigga
Don't even dare
Niggas try to act like they don't—, bitch
That's why I gotta flex sometimes
'Cause niggas just try to act like you just not that motherfuckin' nigga like
Like you just really don't do it how you do it
Like niggas will really try to act like you don't do what you do
Nigga look you dead in your face
And really act like you don't do it to the level that you do it
That's why sometimes you gotta come through
And just do it at the level that you do it in front of every nigga face
So they know the difference between you, the real niggas
And the mothafuckin' fraudulent niggas, man
Don't never get it fucked up
If a nigga can't do it like you do it
Sometimes you gotta do it in front of his fuckin' face so he'll know forever
Damn, that nigga did it how I always wanted to do it
And I'll never be able to do it like that
Bitch it's a difference (Ah)
(These are the same ones telling our people what we are
And we aren't because we're just not working hard enough
And that mentality is what we're up against today
But this is good to know because this time, when we march on the Capitol
You can go ahead and let 'em know long before we get there
We're coming to get that check)"

One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind

Never peddled rock, never said a lot, only what need to be said
Got a little guap, when you get a lot, won't no bitch leave you on read
Don't push me, nigga, my feet on the ledge
This game is like follow the leader, if you looking closely enough, then you'll see that I led
The moves that I made, the people I fed, the evil I ducked
They minds is too feeble, they lean on they crutch
I'm bleeding from fighting my demons head up
When I get defeated, believe I get up
I come from a city most niggas ain't heard of until they popped in my first CD, now look
I'm on that Mount Rushmore, you niggas can't front no more, bitch, I'ma reign until FEMA show up
When shots got to ringing, like freedom, I ducked
E&J fell out my cup
Them bullets fly by, that shit sober you up
I'm proud of my niggas, they never switched up
Don't care if it's Michael B. Jordan that's calling my woman to fuck, she ain't gon' never pick up
Sadly, I can't say the same for you niggas
A couple of dollars be changing you niggas
I pray for you niggas, but

One hundred mil' and I'm still on the, uh

It's not 'bout the money, it's more about time
Shit makes sense when you see how I spend mine
Burst through the ceiling, I'm feeling sublime
Can't leave the game yet, I feel like LeBron

Copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, ""Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it""
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder can you hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills but I know it ain't gon'

Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Weren't puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy T-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just wanna leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Tryna explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar, for every battle I fought
